## Why Data Science?
Every company is searching for data-driven decision makers, and this path will teach you the skills you need to become just that. You'll learn to manipulate data with SQL and Python, the foundational languages of data science and analytics. Along the way, you'll complete real-world projects like analyzing a sales funnel and building a Machine Learning powered recommendation engine.

## After this Path, you will be able to:
* Create programs using Python 3
* Move off of the Codecademy platform with the Command Line, Jupyter Notebook, Git, and GitHub Desktop
* Acquire and query data with SQL and BeautifulSoup
* Manipulate data using NumPy and pandas
* Wrangle and tidy data with pandas
* Summarize and analyze data with scikit-learn
* Implement many different hypothesis tests using Python
* Visualize data using Matplotlib and seaborn
* Communicate data science findings effectively
* Work with text data using natural language processing
* Build, train, and test a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models
* Understand the fundamentals of deep learning
* Work with aggregate functions and joins in SQL
