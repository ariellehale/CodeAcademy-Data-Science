-- 1. Let’s see which plans are used by which premium members! The column membership_plan_id in premium_users should match the column id in plans. Join plans and premium_users and select: user_id from premium_users description from plans (Be sure to select the columns in this order).

SELECT premium_users.user_id, plans.description
FROM premium_users
JOIN plans
  ON plans.id = premium_users.membership_plan_id;

-- 2. Let’s see the titles of songs that were played by each user! The column song_id in plays should match the column id in songs. Join plays to songs and select: user_id from plays play_date from plays title from songs (Be sure to select the columns in this order)

 SELECT plays.user_id, 
   plays.play_date, 
   songs.title
 FROM plays
 JOIN songs
   ON plays.song_id = songs.id;

-- 3. Which users aren’t premium users? Use a LEFT JOIN to combine users and premium_users and select id from users. The column id in users should match the column user_id in premium_users. Use a WHERE clause to limit the results to users where premium_users.user_id IS NULL. This will remove premium users and leave you with only free users.

SELECT users.id
FROM users
LEFT JOIN premium_users
   ON users.id = premium_users.user_id
WHERE premium_users.user_id IS NULL;
