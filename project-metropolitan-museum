 -- Start by getting a feel for the met table:
 SELECT *
 FROM met
 LIMIT 10;
 
 -- How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?
 SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM met;
 
 -- Count the number of pieces where the category includes ‘celery’.
 SELECT COUNT(category)
 FROM met
 WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';
 
-- Find the title and medium of the oldest piece(s) in the collection.
SELECT date, title, medium
FROM met
WHERE date LIKE '%1600%';

-- Find the top 10 countries with the most pieces in the collection.
SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Find the categories HAVING more than 100 pieces.
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

-- Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver’. And sort in descending order.
SELECT medium, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE medium LIKE '%gold%'
OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1;
